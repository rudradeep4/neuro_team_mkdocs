I hold a Master's degree from the [École Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et des Microtechniques (ENSMM)](https://www.supmicrotech.fr/en) in Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. I did my final master internship in the Neuro group, to work on a closed-loop system to control the pitch of human voice. To be a closed-loop system, it needed to measure the pitch and then to modify the resulting pitch, all this in few milliseconds to not perturb the sensory-motor human feedback system. <br>
Now I work as a research engineer to do even more signal processing on voice recordings but also on photoplethysmograph (PPG) data; cleaning and preparing subject recordings as databases or stimuli; or even doing some Linear Mixed-effect Modeling (LMM) to analyse some statistical effects during projects. I'm continuing to deepen my skills and discovering new aspects of research while preparing myself for a possible PhD position in the future.
