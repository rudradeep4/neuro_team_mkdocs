_PhD Student, FEMTO Neuro group._<br>

I have a Bachelor's degree in Internet of Things from Xi'an University of Technology, as well as a Master's in Biomedical Engineering from Shenzhen University, where my graduate thesis focused on intra- and inter-individual variability of EEG signals. My research in the *Neuro Group* is applying modern control theory to the analysis and control of participants' covert sensory electrophysiological responses to continuous streams of sounds during sleep, as one of 10 PhDs funded by Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions - Doctoral Networks (https://lullabyte.de/).
